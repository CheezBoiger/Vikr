TODO List for the Vikr Renderer Engine. 
- Experimental, Try to lean towards Data Oriented Design.
- Mathematics!
  - Implement Linear Algebra Commonality toolsets.
  - Need Vector4, 3, 2, and Matrix4, 3, 2, 1.
  - Translation, Rotation, Scale, Shear.
  - Cross and dot product
  - Lerp
  - Quaternions
    - Slerp
    - Euler Angles

- Renderer Engine
  - Light rendering model (blinn-phong for now.)
    
    - Deferred Lighting!
      - G-Buffer (OpenGL for now)
    - Requiring the use of FrameBuffers!

  - OpenGL and Vulkan Implementations
    - Start with OpenGL FIRST!! Wrapping.
    - Mesh and Model Objects.
    - graphics commands.
      - Render Command (obvious)
      - Group Command (for grouped commands to use)
      - Custom Command (for custom commands)
    - Render Target! for Post processing!
    - Shader Class
      - I want to implement a Shader Preprocessor for #include (GLSL omits this for GOOD reasons)
    - Shader Compiler implementation
      - Ease of use for Shader programming.
      - Parser for compiling shaders.
    - Camera and free movement! // Abstract Camera needed.
      - Quaternion based!
    - Lighting and shading models
    - Implement the Framebuffer for the rendering pipeline.

- Vikr Filesystem!  
  - Implement Filesystem handling for Folders/Directories of the Operating system.
    - Windows (WIN32 NAT)
    - Linux
    - OS X (I dunno, can't test it :c )
  - Require Shader/Resource directory for better handling with our Vikr Editor in the future.

FUTURE WORKS
- Animation! // Most likely
  - Mesh Skinning and Skeletons
  - Develop bone heiarchy 
- Audio (Optional!)
- Moving to Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
  - This is going to be in the future!
